          The game had already been on the list of the top board games in the world but it gathered even more interest in the lockdown period. It steered even the non-gamers’ attention towards itself and became the undeniable interest of everyone who had played Ludo board game sometime in their childhood. <br><br>
The larger perception tells that the nostalgic value Ludo carries and the boring time people had been having were the reasons for the Ludo King rage. The game when created was one of its kinds to be played online with family and friends and even strangers.  Initially it was contemplated that the gaming industry would be affected to some extent along with business and commerce in the global lockdowns. Surprisingly that turned out to be wrong for some mobile games since at least in South Asia people’s preference for Ludo King proves that they are still drawn to the old Ludo game.
